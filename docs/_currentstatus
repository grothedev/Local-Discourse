current status right now: 
	updating ui. post operations, comment box, comments toggle stuff
	fixing all the noticed bugs since dev release and adding the missing features

next steps: 
	fix bugs:
		
	add missing features:
		enter radius manually
		show radius units
		ui toggle for comment expand/collapse
		
	refine the UI overall
	
	
	go through and do all the error handling


	bootstrap inputgroups

	
to be thinking about: 
	i think i will keep the app working this way (with js and php) until i get to a point where it can be used effectively by the small group of clubs at ISU. 
	when things get more complex i think i will have to switch to django. 
	i should make some detailed documentation for this app to send to people who are interested in it. also to open source it when the time comes.
