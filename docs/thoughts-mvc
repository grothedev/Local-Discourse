make functions follow MVC architecture. 
		Model.requestPosts(json_string)
			gets posts from server, updates the model
		Controller.requestPosts()
			gets the data from html, puts it into a json string, calls Model.requestPosts
			updates view

		Model.makePost(json_string)
			posts post to server, 
		Contoller.makePost()
			gets the data from html, puts it into a json string, calls Model.makePost
			updates view

		Model.makeComment(json_string)
			posts comment to server
		Controller.makeComment(postId, parentId) //parentId of the comment you are making
			gets data from html, puts it into json string, call Model.makeComment

		basically just continue seperating model and controller processes in the functions
		make a debug page that just shows a view of the entire model and updates that view each time it changes
